# Data Wrangling I

Perform the following operations using Python on any open source dataset (e.g., `data.csv`):

- Import all the required Python Libraries.

- Locate an open source dataset from the web (e.g., https://www.kaggle.com).  
  Provide a clear description of the data and its source (i.e., URL of the website).

- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

- Data Preprocessing:
  - Check for missing values in the data using Pandas `isnull()` function.
  - Use `describe()` function to get initial statistics.
  - Provide variable descriptions.
  - Identify types of variables.
  - Check the dimensions of the DataFrame.

- Data Formatting and Data Normalization:
  - Summarize the types of variables by checking the data types (character, numeric, integer, factor, logical).
  - Apply proper type conversions if variables are not in the correct data type.

- Turn categorical variables into quantitative variables in Python.

- In addition to the code and outputs, explain every operation performed in the above steps and explain everything done to import, read, or scrape the dataset.

# Data Wrangling II

Create an **Academic Performance** dataset of students and perform the following operations using Python:

1. Scan all variables for missing values and inconsistencies.  
   If missing values and/or inconsistencies are found, use suitable techniques to handle them.

2. Scan all numeric variables for outliers.  
   If outliers are found, use suitable techniques to handle them.

3. Apply data transformations on at least one variable.  
   The purpose of the transformation should be one of the following:
   - Change the scale for better understanding of the variable
   - Convert a non-linear relation into a linear one
   - Decrease skewness and convert the distribution into a normal distribution  

   Reason and document the approach properly.
